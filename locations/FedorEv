Fyodor tried to hit Kotova, but he easily parried Fyodor hand and hit his forehead to the nose Fedor. Fedor went limp and kept it from falling only Kotov "Well, well, you just thought up fall? We`re just talking here, is not it?" By Fyodor jumped back Shulga and a run kicked him in the kidneys, from what Theodore groaned and began to twitch in the hands Kotova. Kotov angrily remarked "What hurts, something? So we started to talk." Suddenly Fyodor Kotov easily lifted off the ground and threw it on the asphalt.

Kotov nod "Normally, will proceed." Fyodor lying on the pavement groaned and clutched his head. Auburn walked up to him and said, "Slysh, kid. Tomorrow arrow hammered. They will understand, how to punish you, and mind you, if you do not come, it will be worse." Shulga happily jumped to lying Fedor "Let`s not kid come, without you decide, cheek, or will you take the ass podmahivat." Kotov grimaced in disgust and said, "Come on guys drink beer.
