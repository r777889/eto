Plus, flying, and I can change the organic life forms. But understand, mostly it is a gift, rather than learning. I`m just learning honed his gift.'

				'You undressed and lay on the couch, Karin began to look around you. It applies what that charms you and use a variety of devices. Cherz half hour survey, She sighed and told you to dress.'
				'You got up from the couch and dressed. You asked Karin "So what? Teach me anything?"'
				'(Karin) - Okay. But only in theory. Listen carefully and heed, I will not repeat. To begin with talk about magic. The magical energy, in Asian culture it is called chakra, produced by all living organisms. This vital energy, deprived of her body slowly begins to die. A clear sign of the lack of magical energy is a bad mood. This in itself can not kill, but it shakes the mind, exhausting the body and the mind, as a result of either the body does not survive, or mind.'
				'That is the magical energy there in the grass, and the trees, and others, it is not in the dead matter. It is the energy of life itself, what awakens the still alive. She and you have been and there, the body itself protects itself, prohibiting the use of this energy. This exhausts the body and can kill him. Magee just know how to circumvent the protection of the body and separating themselves from the magical energy transform it into some kind of action. The main task of any magician is the maximum their potential and learn how to draw their energy as much as possible. But the magicians could not scoop up more energy, than they contain. You`re in something lucky, You entered into as much energy, no matter how much one mage no. You only need to learn how to use it. As I have understood, Your orgasms are capable of handling the energy in their own Rikudo. But each new stage will be given harder. Maybe there is a way to recycle some energy in your own Rikudo. But the main thing, your magical energy supply is almost exhausted, Unlike other magicians. Understand, you theoretically the most powerful magician in the world, since Rikudo was the strongest in the history of. Perhaps there are techniques that can work magic with only the power of Rikudo. Most likely in the scrolls are in the dungeon just had some spells.'
				'(You) - Igor! Igor took one of the rolls!'
				'(Karin) - Just do not think, I`ll be for you to solve your problems. If you want to look for his own Igor.'
				'(You) - I have no idea where he lives. It may pay a visit to the trench.'
				'(Karin) - Do you think the Order of Dawn retreated from such findings? Listen, I see you do not quite understand, What is the Order of Dawn. This is not what the whipping boys. There all the magicians of the highest level. Neither I nor Juugo are not fit even hold a candle to any of them. Any one of them razotret us Juugo without straining. They have the power, their combat experience and unique technology. Do not mess with these guys, they are pros in their field. Their main business of destruction of other magicians and catching demons.'
				'(You) - What else for demons?'
				'(Karin) - Demons demons, creature came to us from other worlds. Perhaps a demon and Rikudo, demons but unlike him, being though with terrible force, but blunt and aggressive. What type of animal is woven from pure magic.'
				'(You) - Guys own. Listen, and you can turn me back into a man?'
				'(Karin) - Can. But I will not. You have no idea how much energy it took me, I squeezed myself to dry and Juugo. I barely had enough energy. Now I have it physically is not enough because of such a crazy energy consumption, I lost a quarter of its ever. And there`s more to consider that now your body begins to adapt to the magic and I have even harder. This will be possible, Only if you bleed the least is magical 10level and pass me all his energy forever. I can make you the same again, but you`ll never be a magician, This way will be good for you is closed.'
				'(Karin) - You are not to look too far into the future. Develop body, Learn to fight, Mine magical power, Train your mind. Gradually everything will rise on the places on which all should be.'
